# Firewall-Rule-Filter

- This project is one of my internship project that i learn about Node.js, React.js, PostgreSql and firewall rules and firewall rule conflict analysis. 

- After a user uploads an SQL file to my system, this SQL file is analyzed to perform a conflict analysis of the firewall rules stored in a specific table within it. The analysis determines the extent to which all the rules conflict with each other, generates the results, and presents them to the user.
